101backbone
===========

A simple [backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) application implementing various [101companies features](http://101companies.org/wiki/Namespace:Feature).


### Current limitations / TODOs

* The nested model of companies and departments is currently not reflected in the Backbone model. Possible solution: use backbone-relational.
* Editing is currently limited to primitve fields. Adding/Removing/Moving departents and employees should be enabled.
* The features of totaling and cutting salaries is missing.
